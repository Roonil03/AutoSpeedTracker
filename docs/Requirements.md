ARM mbed online compiler provides browser-based development but may require code modifications due to different API structures. PlatformIO with Visual Studio Code offers modern development features with excellent IntelliSense support for larger projects.

### Driver Configuration and Setup

USB-to-serial driver installation varies by converter chip type, with FT232RL devices typically auto-installing on Windows 10/11 systems. CH340G converters may require manual driver installation and potential Windows driver signature enforcement modifications. Device Manager verification ensures proper COM port recognition and stable communication with the target microcontroller.

The programming workflow requires specific ISP mode entry procedures, involving precise button sequences to activate the LPC1768's bootloader. Proper timing of ISP and RESET button operations ensures reliable entry into programming mode. Flash Magic configuration includes device selection, COM port assignment, baud rate settings, and oscillator frequency specification for optimal programming performance.

### Hardware Connections

The system assembly follows standard embedded systems practices with careful attention to power distribution and signal integrity. IR sensors connect to GPIO pins P2.10 and P2.11, providing interrupt-capable inputs for precise timing measurements. Power connections require stable 5V distribution to all components, with proper ground reference throughout the system.

LCD interfacing utilizes 4-bit mode to conserve GPIO pins while maintaining full functionality. The connection scheme routes data lines D4-D7 to pins P0.4-P0.7, with control signals RS and EN connected to P0.0 and P0.1 respectively
. Contrast control through a potentiometer ensures optimal display visibility under varying lighting conditions.

Programming interface connections enable code upload through the USB-to-TTL converter
. The serial connection maps converter TX to LPC1768 P0.3 (UART0 RX) and converter RX to P0.2 (UART0 TX), establishing bidirectional communication for ISP programming. Proper ground connection ensures signal integrity during programming operations.

### Software Configuration and Programming

Project creation in Keil μVision requires device selection, startup file integration, and build configuration for hex file generation
. The development process includes source code compilation, linking, and hex file output suitable for Flash Magic programming. Build settings optimization balances code size and execution speed for the specific application requirements.

The programming sequence utilizes Flash Magic's ISP capabilities with specific device settings for LPC1768 operation
. Configuration parameters include device type selection, COM port identification, baud rate specification (typically 9600 for initial programming), and oscillator frequency setting (12.000 MHz for standard LPC1768 boards). Programming options enable block erase, hex file loading, and post-programming verification for reliable code deployment.

## Testing and Calibration Procedures
### System Verification

Initial testing validates hardware connections and software functionality through systematic verification procedures
. Power-on diagnostics confirm LCD operation with startup messages, IR sensor responsiveness, and basic system timing. The display sequence progresses from "Speed Meter" startup message to "Ready..." operational status, indicating proper system initialization.

Sensor calibration requires precise positioning at exactly 10.0cm separation distance for accurate speed calculations
. Detection range testing verifies proper IR sensor operation across the expected object sizes and materials. Sensitivity adjustment through onboard potentiometers optimizes detection reliability while minimizing false triggers from ambient conditions.

Speed measurement validation utilizes objects with known velocities to verify calculation accuracy
. The system displays calculated speeds with two decimal precision, enabling assessment of measurement quality. Over-limit detection testing confirms proper "OVER LIMIT" display for speeds exceeding the 30 cm/s threshold, validating the safety monitoring functionality.

### Troubleshooting and Maintenance

Common issues include LCD display problems, sensor responsiveness failures, and programming difficulties
. LCD troubleshooting focuses on power connections, contrast adjustment, and pin configuration verification. Sensor issues typically involve power supply problems, sensitivity adjustments, or physical alignment corrections.

Programming problems often relate to COM port configuration, ISP mode entry procedures, or USB driver issues
. Systematic verification of hardware connections, driver installation, and Flash Magic settings resolves most programming difficulties. Baud rate reduction to 9600 bps often improves programming reliability in challenging communication environments.
